# v5.4.0 release notes

- Added a `context.Context` field to the `validation.Options` and `validation.Context` structures. If not provided, it defaults to `context.Background()`.
- The built-in validation middleware now uses the request context in the validation options.
	- The DB instance used in the validation options by the built-in validation middleware was already injected with the request context. You don't need to update your custom validators.
	- You may want to update places where you are using manual validation. However, those will continue to work exactly like they used to if you don't change anything.
