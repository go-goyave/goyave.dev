# v5.3.0 release notes

- Added `slog.DiscardLogger()`, which redirects logs to `io.Discard`.
- `testutil.TestServer` now uses the discard logger by default instead of `testutil.LogWriter`.

This change was made so logs written during tests should usually be silent. To make it more convenient, this is now the default behavior. Sometimes it is still handy to see logs while writing or debugging a test. For this use-case, you can use `testutil.LogWriter`:
```go
func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
	opts := goyave.Options{
		Logger: slog.New(slog.NewHandler(true, &testutil.LogWriter{t: t})),
	}
	server := testutil.NewTestServerWithOptions(t, opts)
	//...
}
```
