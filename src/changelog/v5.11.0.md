# v5.11.0 release notes

- Authentication
  - Added `auth.SchemeAuthenticator` interface that authenticators can implement to indicate the scheme they are using. On authentication failure, the auth middleware adds the [`WWW-Authenticate` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/WWW-Authenticate) to the response if the authenticator implements `auth.SchemeAuthenticator`.
  - Added `auth.MiddlewareWithRealm` to provide custom realm description for the `WWW-Authenticate` header.
- Added an explicit error message when `server.RegisterRoutes` is called more than once.
- Static file serving: fixed an issue on Windows which resulted in 404 errors if the filesystem was embedded and the requested path contained slashes.
