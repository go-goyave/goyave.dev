# v5.1.1 release notes

- Validation:
	- Fixed a panic when validating a property of an object contained by a root array.
	- Fixed a panic when adding an error on a root array element.
	- FIxed incorrect error path when adding an error on a root array element.
- `Response.SetWriter()` will now `Init()` the given writer if it implements `goyave.Composable`.
- Fixed status handlers in subrouters not being used. Only the main router's status handlers were effective. For special routes (not found, method not allowed), the main router's status handler will be used.
