# v5.7.0 release notes

- `util/walk` package
  - `walk.Path`:
    - `Path` now support escaping characters (`.`, `[`, `]`, `*`, `\`) using a backslash.
    - `Path.String()` outputs the path with the escape characters. 
    - Improved illegal path syntax error to make it easier for developers to troubleshoot.
    - New methods:
      - `Path.IsWildcard`: returns true if the path has unescaped "*" as Name.
      - `Path.UnescapedString`: returns a string representation of the path without the escape characters.
  - New function `Unescape`: remove escape characters from a path without parsing it. 
- Validation:
  - field paths in rule sets now support escaping characters using a backslash.
  - validating both the the literal object fields and the wildcard (`*`) isn't allowed anymore. This goes with the same logic as the repeated paths rule introduced in [v5.6.0](./v5.6.0.md).
  - minor optimizations.
- Added support for bigquery database dialect. You must disable prepared statements for the dialect to work, as this is not supported by this driver.
- Upgraded to golangci-lint v2. New rules and changes to the configuration were made. Minor changes to the codebase were made to fix the newly reported lint issues.
- Updated dependencies.
