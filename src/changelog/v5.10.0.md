# v5.10.0 release notes

- Validation: `UniqueArray` / `ExistsArray` improvements
  - This validator was previously using a naive dialect detection based on the config `database.connection`. This didn't work with custom dialectors. It now detects the dialect and generate the corresponding query based on the `gorm.Dialector`'s name.
  - Fixed query generation for BigQuery.
  - Validation middleware now checks if server database is not `nil` instead of relying on config `database.connection`. This improves support for servers where the database connection has been setup manually.
- Added `server.HasDB()` to check if the server's database connection is setup or not without having to rely on config `database.connection`.
- Added `*Options.ListenConfig` (type `net.ListenConfig`). This option let developers customize the network listener settings and keep-alives to better accommodate large traffic scenarios.
