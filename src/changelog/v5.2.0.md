# v5.2.0 release notes

- Added support for response and chained writer flushing.
- Added support for the `clickhouse` database dialect.
- Updated the `UniqueArray`/`ExistsArray` validators to support ClickHouse.
- Changed the default status handler for code `400 Bad Request` to the new `goyave.ParseErrorStatusHandler`. This status handler's behavior is identical to the previous one except it returns explicit error messages in the response when the parse middleware fails to parse a user's request.
- Added `lang.Default` global variable, which contains the builtin default `en-US` language. 
- Fixed a panic if no `Language` is given in the `validation.Options` when manually validating. Instead, `lang.Default` will be used.
- Added deflate, lzw, br and zstd encoders for the compress middleware.
