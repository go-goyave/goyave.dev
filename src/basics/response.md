# Response

[[toc]]

## Introduction

`*goyave.Response` implements `http.ResponseWriter`. This wrapper controls the response flow and brings a number of convenient methods to write HTTP responses. All writes first go through the `*goyave.Response`, even when using [chained writers](#chained-writers).

## Pre-writing

`PreWrite` is an operation always called before any `Write`. Because the HTTP headers must be written **before** the response body, a write will automatically send them to the client. `*goyave.Response` uses this hook to make sure that the correct status code is written instead of the default `200 OK`. This way, you can define a status code using `response.Status()` without sending the response header immediately. The status code can then be read by middleware and status handlers to process a dynamic response, even if the headers are not yet written.

## Writing responses

You can set the status without immediately writing the response headers. This differs from `response.WriteHeader()`, which writes the response header. It is recommended to use `response.Status()`.
```go
response.Status(http.StatusUnauthorized)
```
:::info
Calling this method a second time will have no effect.

`response.JSON()` marshals anything given to it into JSON, adds the `Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8` header automatically and writes the response. Alternatively, if a simple string is enough, `response.String()` will work for you:
```go
response.JSON(http.StatusOK, someDTO)
response.String(http.StatusOK, "Hello world")
```

You can write files from any file system implementing `fs.StatFS` with either `response.File()` (which will send the file as "inline") or `response.Download()` (which will send the file as attachment).
```go
import (
	"embed"
	"goyave.dev/goyave/v5/util/fsutil"
)

//go:embed resources
var resources embed.FS

//...
fs := fsutil.NewEmbed(resources)
response.File(fs, "resources/img/logo.png")
response.Download(fs, "resources/manual.pdf")
```

You can also write to the response the standard way using `Write()`:
```go
response.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
_, err := response.Write(bytes)
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```

:::info
As opposed to `response.JSON()` and `response.String()`, `response.Write()` can be called multiple times. It can be used for **streaming** large responses to the client, and supports usual io helpers such as `io.Copy()`.
:::

### Unsupported features

Because it is not the focus of the framework, certain rare use-cases are not covered, such as rendering templates and redirects. Because `*goyave.Response` implements `http.ResponseWriter`, you can still use it as a regular writer:

```go
import (
	"html/template"
	"net/http"

	"goyave.dev/goyave/v5"
	"goyave.dev/goyave/v5/util/errors"
)

//...

// Redirect
http.Redirect(response, request.Request(), "/target", http.StatusPermanentRedirect)

// html template
tmpl := template.Must(template.ParseFiles("layout.html"))
data := map[string]any{
	//...
}
err := tmpl.Execute(response, data)
if err != nil {
	response.Error(errors.New(err))
	return
}
```

## Error handling

When an error is brought back all the way up to the controller, you can handle it gracefully with `response.Error()`. This method will log the error and set the response status to `500 Internal Server Error`. If debugging is enabled (config `app.debug`) and nothing has been written to the response yet, the error message will be written to the response body as well. 

```go
response.Error(err)
```

`WriteDBError()` allows you to more easily handle database errors. It takes an error and automatically writes HTTP status code `404 Not Found` if the error is a `gorm.ErrRecordNotFound` error. It calls `Response.Error()` if there is another type of error. This method returns `true` if there is an error. You can then safely `return` in you controller.

```go
func (ctrl *ProductController) Show(response *goyave.Response, request *goyave.Request) {
	product := model.Product{}
	result := ctrl.DB().First(&product, request.RouteParams["id"])
	if response.WriteDBError(result.Error) {
		return
	}
	response.JSON(http.StatusOK, product)
}
```

## Chained writers

It is possible to replace the `io.Writer` used by the `*goyave.Response`. This allows for more flexibility when manipulating the data you send to the client. It makes it easier to compress your response, write it to logs, etc. You can chain as many writers as you want.

Usually, the response's writer is replaced in a middleware. The current writer is taken from the `*goyave.Response`, and used as destination for the newly created chained writer. This new chained writer is then set in `*goyave.Response`.

:::center

:::

Chained writers are **components**, just like middleware and controllers. They can compose with `goyave.CommonWriter`, a structure that implements all the basic methods a chained writer must implement: `goyave.PreWriter`, `io.Closer` and `goyave.Flusher`.

Note that at the time a chained writer's `Write()` method is called, the request header is already written. Therefore, changing headers or status doesn't have any effect. If you want to alter the headers, do so in a `PreWrite(b []byte)` function (from the `goyave.PreWriter` interface).

The writers are **closed** at the end of the **finalization stage**, telling them that the application is entirely done with this request.

The following example is a simple implementation of a chained writer and its middleware for logging everything sent by the client:
```go
import (
	"io"

	"goyave.dev/goyave/v5"
	"goyave.dev/goyave/v5/util/errors"
)

type LogWriter struct {
	goyave.CommonWriter
	response *goyave.Response
	body     []byte
}

func NewWriter(response *goyave.Response) *LogWriter {
	return &LogWriter{
		CommonWriter: goyave.NewCommonWriter(response.Writer()),
		response:     response,
	}
}

func (w *LogWriter) Write(b []byte) (int, error) {
	w.body = append(w.body, b...)
	n, err := w.CommonWriter.Write(b)
	return n, errors.New(err)
}

func (w *LogWriter) Close() error {
	w.Logger().Info("RESPONSE", "body", string(w.body))
	return errors.New(w.CommonWriter.Close())
}

type LogMiddleware struct {
	goyave.Component
}

func (m *LogMiddleware) Handle(next goyave.Handler) goyave.Handler {
	return func(response *goyave.Response, request *goyave.Request) {
		logWriter := NewWriter(response)
		response.SetWriter(logWriter)

		next(response, request)
	}
}
```

You can override the default behavior of `PreWrite()`, `Close()` and `Flush()`. If you do so, make sure to call the `CommonWriter`'s implementation so the writers are correctly chained for these operations:

```go
func (w *Writer) PreWrite(b []byte) {
	//...
	w.CommonWriter.PreWrite(b)
}

func (w *Writer) Close() error {
	//...
	return errors.New(w.CommonWriter.Close())
}

func (w *Writer) Flush() error {
	//...
	return errors.New(w.CommonWriter.Flush())
}
```

:::info
Chained writers support both `http.Flusher` and `goyave.Flusher` for their underlying writers. The only difference between those interfaces is that `http.Flusher`'s `Close()` method doesn't return an `error` but `goyave.Flusher`'s does.

## Hijack

Goyave responses implement [`http.Hijacker`](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Hijacker). Hijacking is the process of taking over the connection of the current HTTP request. This can be used for example for [websockets](/advanced/websockets.html).

Middleware executed after controller handlers, as well as status handlers, keep working as usual after a connection has been hijacked. Callers should properly set the response status to ensure middleware and status handler execute correctly. Usually, callers of the `Hijack` method set the HTTP status to `http.StatusSwitchingProtocols`. If no status is set, the regular behavior will be kept and `204 No Content` will be set as the response status.

Writing to the `*goyave.Response` after being hijacked should be avoided as it would cause an error. Therefore it is advised to always check if the connection was hijacked (using `Response.Hijacked()`) before writing anything when inside a middleware that has operations executed **after the controller handler**. Calling `response.Status()` after a hijack is safe but won't have any effect.

After a call to Hijack, the original request body reader must not be used. The original request's `context.Context` remains valid and is not canceled until the end of the request lifecycle.

Chained writers are **not discarded** when a connection is hijacked, and will still be closed as usual at the end of the request's lifecycle.
